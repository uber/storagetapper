/*Package shutdown provides a mechanism for graceful shutdown of multithreaded programs.
It combines functionality of WaitGroups and context.WithCancel, to account
number running threads and notify threads waiting in the blocking calls.

Setup/Wait allowed to be called sequentially only
Register can be called only from the thread where Setup/Wait called or from the
thread for which register has been called already.
